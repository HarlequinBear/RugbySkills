<h1>Attack</h1>

<h3>What to look for</h3>

<p>It's rare that a player can break through a tackle. The only way to break through the D-line is to find gaps. An even better strategy is to create gaps.</p>

<p>If you send a big forward or a pod of forwards into a bunch of defenders, it may take 2 or 3 of them to bring him down. They may also commit players to the ruck that follows. This means that there could be 5 of their players in the ruck. Therefore, there are only 10 players left in their D-line. 1 or 2 of them may be covering the rear, leaving just 8 in the line.</p>

<p>All of the players must look at what's in front of them. If there are no guards or bodyguards, do a pick & go. If there's no rear cover, kick and chase or kick to touch so that the lineout is closer to their line.</p>

<h5>Spotting a mismatch</h5>

<p>If you're a big forward and you see a small player in front of you without any support, you may decide to run straight at them and attempt to fend or bounce them off.</p>

<p>If you're a fast-running back and you spot a big, slow forward in front of you try to run around them, sidestep, throw a dummy or duck out of their tackle.</p>

<h5>Decisons</h5>

<img class="image" src="/Images/3v3.jpg">

<p>The above image shows 3 orange players attacking and 3 greens defending. The number 2 player has the ball and they are likely to get tackled by their opposite number. They need to look around at their options.</p>

<p>The orange teammates should be shouting, so that the ball-carrier knows where they are without having to look. The number 2 will see that there's a defender opposite him, but also a defender opposite each of his teammates. Passing to either player could mean that they get smashed. This would be called a hospital pass. So, it may be worth just taking the tackle and hoping that there are better opportunities in the next phases.</p>

<p>But there is something that the number 2 can do... Instead of running at the green number 2, he could run at the 1 or 3. This can force a gap to appear.</p>

<p>This image shows the 2 running at the opposite 3. This forces green 3 to decide whether to commit to orange 2, leaving orange 3 undefended, or to trust green 2 to make the tackle. If green 2 and 3 shuffle sideways to track their marks, then that could also widen the gap between green 1 & 2 for orange 1 to run through.</p>

<p>Orange 2 could also kick the ball behind the defenders for their teammates to chase. There are too many options to discuss here. Watch lots of rugby matches on TV and learn what they do. Discuss ideas with your teammates and coaches. Experiment in training or during friendly matches.</p>

<h5>The fly-half</h5>

<p>The fly-half is the player who will usually shout the orders for a team that is attacking. They'll send the forwards in waves of attacks to commit defenders and open up gaps for the backline. When the fly-half sees an opprtunity, they'll call for the ball and either kick into space or pass to his runners to exploit an overlap (more attackers than defenders).</p>

<p>It's not just the fly-half's job. All players will see opportunities or suddenly find themselves in the position of first-receiver, where they'll have to make a call.</p>

<h3>Attacking structures</h3>

<p>The two most popular structures are 1-3-3-1 and 2-4-2. These numbers represent pods of forwards. For example, in 1-3-3-1, there's a forward on each wing and 2 pods of 3 forwards in the middle.</p>

<p>It's not always forwards. The backs can join a pod if they need to, to ensure that there's always 3 or 4 players launching themselves at the defence at any time. This prevents a player from getting picked-up and thrown backwards. It also means the ruck can be won before a defender can jackal or counter-ruck.</p>

<h3>1-3-3-1</h3>

<p>Junior or amateur teams can win matches just by using this structure alone. This video explains it all:</p>

<h3>2-4-2</h3>

<p>Here's a longer video about the 2-4-2 formation. Professional teams will change their structure mid-game to confuse the opposition. For everyone else, it's best to pick one structure per match.</p>

<h3>2-2-3-1</h3>

<p>Yet another structure. Choose a structure that suits your players' strengths. You may find that your opposition will practise defending the structure you used in your last match against them, so switch it around.</p>
